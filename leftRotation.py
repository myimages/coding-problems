# Left rotation - shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left
# E.g. 2 left rotations are performed on [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Results in an array [3, 4, 5, 1, 2
# Given an array of n integers and a number d, perform d left rotations on the array
# Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers

# Input Format

# The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of (the number of integers) and (the number of left rotations you must perform).
# The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

# Constraints 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 1 <= d <= n
# 1 <= ai <= 10^6
